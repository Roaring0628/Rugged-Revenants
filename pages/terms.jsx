          similar taxes. It is also Your responsibility to withhold, collect,
          report, and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate tax
          authorities. RR is not responsible for withholding, collecting,
          reporting, or remitting any sales, use, value-added, or similar tax

        </p>
        <p>
          (h) <strong>Your Information</strong>: RR may determine, in its sole
          discretion, that it is necessary to obtain certain information about

          with selling Collectibles to You. You agree to provide RR such

        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl">5. Ownership of Collectible</h2>
        <p>
          As a purchaser of a Collectible, You own a cryptographic token
          representing the Underlying Artwork’s creative artwork as a piece of
          property, but You do not own the creative artwork itself. If You
          acquire a Collectible, You acquire all personal property rights to
          that Collectible, such as the right to freely sell, transfer, or
          otherwise dispose of that Collectible. However, in exercising personal
          property rights over the Collectible, You represent and warrant that
          You will not transfer a Collectible in any Secondary Transaction to a
          transferee that is a Prohibited Transferee. Purchasers of Collectibles
          do not have any legal ownership, right, or title to any copyrights,
          trademarks, or other intellectual property rights to the Underlying
          Art, excepting the limited license granted by the Terms.{" "}
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl">6. License of Underlying Art </h2>
        <p>
          RR reserves all exclusive copyrights to artworks underlying NFTs on
          the Collectibles Website, including but not limited to the right to
          reproduce, to prepare derivative works, to display, to perform, and to
          distribute the artworks. Purchasers may not infringe on any of the
          exclusive rights of the copyright belonging exclusively to RR. If You
          acquire a Collectible, RR hereby grants to You, for so long as You own
          the Collectible (as recorded on the relevant blockchain), a limited,
          non-exclusive, non- sublicensable, royalty-free license to use, copy,
          and display the Underlying Art linked with Your purchased Collectible
          solely for the following purposes: (i) for Your own personal,
          non-commercial use, including to create one back-up copy of the
          Underlying Art and a single physical print out of the Underlying Art,
          each to be retained only for so long as You own the associated
          Collectible; and (ii) efforts to sell or otherwise transfer the
          associated Collectible consistent with the ownership of it (e.g.,
          posting the Underlying Art on a sales listing on an NFT marketplace).
          The license in the prior sentence is non-transferrable, except that it
          will automatically transfer in connection with the transfer of the
          Collectible.{" "}
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl">7. Reservation of Rights </h2>
        <p>
          The Underlying Art is licensed, not sold. All rights to the Underlying
          Art not expressly provided for in the Terms and are hereby reserved by
          RR. RR owns and will retain all title, interest, ownership rights and
          intellectual property rights in and to the Underlying Art. Without
          limitation, You shall not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt
          to do any of the following without express prior written consent from
          RR: (i) modify the Underlying Art; (ii) use the Underlying Art to
          advertise, market, or sell any product or service; (iii) use the
          Underlying Art in connection with media that depicts hatred,
          intolerance, violence, cruelty, or any other subject matter that
          reflects negatively on RR; (iv) use the Underlying Art in any other
          form of media, except solely for Your own personal, non-commercial use
          for so long as You own the Collectible; (v) sell, distribute for
          commercial gain (including, without limitation, giving away in the
          hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise commercialize
          merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Underlying
          Art; (vi) attempt to register any trademark, copyright, or otherwise
          acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the
          Underlying Art; or (vii) otherwise utilize the Underlying Art for Your
          or any third party’s commercial benefit.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl">
          8. Termination of License to Underlying Art{" "}
        </h2>
        <p>
          Your license to the Underlying Art shall automatically and immediately
          terminate without notice, and all rights shall revert to RR if at any
          time: (i) You breach any portion of these Terms; (ii) You engage in
          any unlawful activity related to the Collectible (including
          transferring the Collectible to a Prohibited Transferee); or (iii) if
          RR determines, in RR’s sole discretion, You have disparaged RR, its
          brands or products. Upon any termination, discontinuation or
          cancellation of Your license to Underlying Art, RR may disable Your
          access to the Underlying Art and You must delete, remove, or otherwise
          destroy any backup or single digital or physical copy of the
          Underlying Art.{" "}
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl">
          9. RR’s Rights and Obligations to Underlying Art
        </h2>
        <p>
          RR is not responsible for repairing, supporting, replacing, or
          maintaining the website hosting the Underlying Art, nor does RR have
          the obligation to maintain any connection or link between a
          Collectible and the corresponding Underlying Art.{" "}
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl">10. Warranty Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and except as
          otherwise specified in a writing by RR, (a) the Collectibles are sold
          on an “as is” and “as available” basis without warranties of any kind,
          and RR expressly disclaims all implied warranties as to the
          Collectibles, including, without limitation, implied warranties of
          merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and
          non-infringement; (b) RR does not represent or warrant that the
          Collectibles are reliable, current or error-free, meet your
          requirements, or that defects in the Collectibles will be corrected;
          and (c) RR cannot and does not represent or warrant that the
          Collectibles or the delivery mechanism for Collectibles are free of
          viruses or other harmful components.{" "}
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl">11. Assumption of Risk </h2>
        <p>
          Without limiting the foregoing, RR explicitly disclaims any implied
          warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet
          enjoyment and non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of the
          course of dealing or usage of trade. RR makes no warranty that the
          Collectibles will meet your requirements or be available on an
          uninterrupted, secure, or, error-free basis. RR makes no warranty
          regarding the quality, accuracy, suitability, timeliness,
          truthfulness, completeness or reliability of any information or
          content on the Collectibles. Descriptions of the Underlying Art are
          posted on the Collectibles Website for informational purposes only and
          may not be independently verified by Magic Eden and/or its partners.
          Therefore, your reliance on such information is at your own risk. You
          should always verify information on the Collectibles Website before
          making a bid or purchase. Because RR does not control third-party
          sites and/or resources, you acknowledge and agree that RR is not
          responsible for the accuracy or availability of any materials and/or
          external sites or resources. Your interactions with other Collectibles
          Website users are solely between You and such users. You agree that
          the Collectibles website will not be responsible for any loss or
          damage incurred as the result of any such interactions. If there is a
          dispute between You and any Collectibles Website user, neither RR nor
          Magic Eden is under any obligation to become involved.

            Risk of Losing Access to Collectibles Due to Loss of Private Key(s)

          : A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to
          control and dispose of Collectibles stored in Your digital wallet or

          ownership record maintained in the applicable blockchain network. Any
          transfer of title that might occur in any unique digital asset occurs
          on the decentralized ledger within such a blockchain network, which RR
          does not control. RR does not guarantee that RR or Magic Eden can
          affect the transfer of title or right in any collectible. You bear
          full responsibility for verifying the identity, legitimacy, and
          authenticity of assets you purchase through the Collectibles Website.
          Notwithstanding indicators and messages that suggest verification, RR
          makes no claims about the identity, legitimacy, or authenticity of
          assets on the Collectibles Website or any purported Secondary
          Transactions. RR is not responsible for any kind of failure, abnormal
          behavior of software (e.g., wallet, smart contract), blockchains, or
          any other features of the collectibles. RR is not responsible for
          casualties due to late reports by developers or representatives (or no
          report at all) of any issues with the blockchain supporting the
          Collectibles, including forks, technical node issues, or any other
          issues having fund losses as a result.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) <strong>Risks Associated with the Solana Protocol</strong>:
          Because Collectibles are based on the Solana protocol, any
          malfunction, breakdown, or abandonment of the Solana protocol may have
          a material adverse effect on the platform or Collectibles. Moreover,
          advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the
          development of quantum computing, could present risks to the
          Collectibles and the platform by rendering ineffective the
          cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Solana protocol.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) <strong>Risk of Mining Attacks</strong>: As with other
          decentralized cryptographic Collectibles based on the Solana protocol,
          the Collectibles are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of
          validating Collectible transactions on the Solana blockchain,
          including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining
          power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks
          present a risk to the platform and the Collectibles, including, but
          not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions
          involving Collectibles.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) <strong>Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses</strong>: Hackers
          or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere
          with the Collectibles in a variety of ways, including, but not limited
          to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based
          attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because
          the platform is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a
          third party or a member of the RR team may intentionally or
          unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure,
          which could negatively affect the platform and the Collectibles.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          (f) <strong>Risks Associated with Markets for Collectibles</strong>:
          RR will not support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or
          external valuation of Collectibles. Even if secondary trading of
          Collectibles is facilitated by third-party exchanges, such exchanges
          may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory
          oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation.
          Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external
          exchange value to Collectibles (e.g., as denominated in a digital or
          fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to
          zero.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          (g) <strong>Risk of Uninsured Losses</strong>: Unlike bank accounts or
          accounts at some other financial institutions, Collectibles are
          uninsured unless You specifically obtain private insurance to insure
          them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no
          public insurer, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or
          private insurance arranged by RR, to offer recourse to You.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          (h){" "}
          <strong>
            Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions
          </strong>
          : The regulatory status of the Collectibles and distributed ledger
          technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is
          difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply
          existing regulations with respect to such technology and its
          applications, including the platform and the Collectibles. It is
          likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or
          regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulations
          affecting distributed ledger technology, its applications, and the
          sale of products derived from such distributed ledger technology,
          including any sales under the Primary Transaction or Secondary
          Transaction and the Collectibles. Regulatory actions could negatively
          impact such sales and the Collectibles in various ways, including, for
          purposes of illustration only, through a determination that
          Collectibles are a regulated financial instrument that requires
          registration or licensing. RR may cease operations in a jurisdiction
          in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation,
          make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially
          undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate
          in such jurisdiction.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          (i) <strong>Risks Arising from Taxation</strong>: The tax
          characterization of Collectibles is uncertain. You must seek Your own
          tax advice in connection with purchasing Collectibles, which may
          result in adverse tax consequences to You, including withholding
          taxes, income taxes, and tax reporting requirements.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          (j) <strong>Unanticipated Risks</strong>: Cryptographic tokens such as
          the Collectibles are a new and untested technology. In addition to the
          risks included in these Terms, there are other risks associated with
          Your purchase, holding, and use of Collectibles, including those that
          the RR cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as
          unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in
          these Terms.{" "}
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl">12. Indemnification </h2>
        <p>
          (a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, You will

          responsibilities or obligations under these Terms, (iii) Your
          violation of these Terms, or (iv) Your violation of any rights of any
          other person or entity.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) RR reserves the right to exercise sole control over the defense,
          at Your expense, of any claim subject to indemnification under Section
          12(a). This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
          indemnities set forth in a written agreement between You and RR.{" "}
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl">13. Limitation of Liability </h2>
        <p>
          (a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) in no event
          will RR or any of the RR parties be liable for any indirect, special,
          incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages of any kind
          (including, but not limited to, where related to loss of revenue,
          income or profits, loss of use or data, or damages for business
          interruption) arising out of or in any way related to the sale or use
          of the Collectibles or otherwise related to these terms, regardless of
          the form of action, whether based in contract, tort (including, but
          not limited to, simple negligence, whether active, passive or
          imputed), or any other legal or equitable theory (even if the party
          has been advised of the possibility of such damages and regardless of
          whether such damages were foreseeable); and (ii) in no event will the
          aggregate liability of RR, whether in contract, warranty, tort
          (including negligence, whether active, passive or imputed), or other
          theory, arising out of or relating to these terms or the use of or
          inability to use the Collectibles, exceed the amount you pay to us for
          the Collectibles.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The limitations set forth in Section 13(a) will not limit or
          exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud, or intentional,
          willful, or reckless misconduct of RR.{" "}
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl">14. Release </h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, You release RR from
          responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and
          consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including,
          but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related
          to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties.
          You expressly waive any rights You may have under any applicable
          legislation as well as any other statute or common law principles that
          would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only
          those claims which You may know or suspect to exist in Your favor at
          the time of agreeing to this release.{" "}

          You agree that these Terms or any claim, dispute, or controversy

          exclusive jurisdiction over any Claim.{" "}

        <p>
          PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS
          ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE ONLY TO INDIVIDUALS LOCATED,
          RESIDENT, OR DOMICILED IN THE UNITED STATES. IF YOU ARE LOCATED,
          RESIDENT OR DOMICILED IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS SECTION REQUIRES YOU
          TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH RR AND LIMITS THE MANNER
          IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM RR.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) <strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>: Except for any disputes,
          claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands, or proceedings
          (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>”) in which either Party
          seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful
          use of intellectual property, including, without limitation,
          copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents,
          You and RR (i) waive Your and RR’s respective rights to have any and
          all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms resolved in a
          court, and (ii) waive Your and RR’s respective rights to a jury trial.
          Instead, You and RR will arbitrate Disputes through binding
          arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons
          charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding
          determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a
          judge or jury in court).

          : <br />
          Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to
          You and RR and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration
          and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any
          other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class
          arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempt to resolve a
          Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of
          individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other
          type of representative action, whether within or outside of
          arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of
          individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) <strong>Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</strong>: Each Party
          will notify the other Party in writing of any Dispute within thirty
          (30) days of the date it arises, so that the Parties can attempt in
          good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to RR shall be
          sent by e- mail to RR at <strong>admin@1kin.io</strong>. Notice to You
          shall be by email to the then-current email address in Your Account.
          Your notice must include (i) Your name, postal address, email address
          and telephone number, (ii) a description in reasonable detail of the
          nature or basis of the Dispute, and (iii) the specific relief that You
          are seeking. If You and RR cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute
          within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the
          applicable Party, then either You or RR may, as appropriate and in
          accordance with this Section 16 (c), commence an arbitration
          proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 16
          (a), file a claim in court.{" "}

          each such Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it

          action in court or in arbitration, either as a class representative or
          class member; and (b) the right to join or consolidate claims with

        <p>
          RR’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
          Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. RR will
          not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under
          these Terms where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond
          its reasonable control. Purchasing Collectibles from RR does not
          create any form of partnership, joint venture or any other similar
          relationship between You and RR. Except as otherwise provided herein,
          these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of You and RR and are
          not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other
          person or entity. You agree and acknowledge that all agreements,

          particular Section or paragraph hereof; (ii) the word including means
          including, but not limited to; (iii) masculine gender shall also
          include the feminine and neutral genders, and vice versa; and (iv)
          words importing the singular shall also include the plural, and vice
          versa. The headings in these Terms are for reference only and shall

          If any term, clause, or provision of these Terms is held unlawful,
          void or unenforceable, then that term, clause, or provision will be
          severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or

          Terms. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of
          these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
          RR will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any
          obligation under these Terms where the delay or failure results from
